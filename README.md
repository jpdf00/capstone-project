# HTML & CSS 2.0 - Project 4: Capstone Project - Conference Page

This is the Capstone project in Microverse's HTML and CSS module. It consists of the creation of a page based on this guide [Cindy Shin in Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) using Boostrap and the preprocessor SASS.
It consists of 3 pages (Main, About and Tickets), designed using the layout, colors and fonts shown on the design guide.
I used Responsive Web Design techniques to style all 3 pages according to the device is being used.
It has 1 breakpoint being style for Mobile Screens and Desktop Screens. I also used grid and flexbox techniques so the elements within the page would ajust to changes in the viewport size.
For the content I based the page on the International Conference on Renewable Energies held in 2020. Used only as an example, not all information is factual.
